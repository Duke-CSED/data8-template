## Materials & Resources

* **Online textbook**: [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science](https://dukecs.github.io/textbook/)
By Ani Adhikari and John DeNero.
* **Computing platform**: [jupyterhub.cs.duke.edu](https://jupyterhub.cs.duke.edu). You will likely want to use your own laptop to access the platform in and out of class. If you do not have access to a laptop, you can use one of the [OIT Computer Labs](https://labs.oit.duke.edu/index.php/sites).

## Assessments

Students will be assesssed in the following ways:

### Team-Based Activities

Students will work together to solve problems in lab (Mondays).

* **Individual Readiness Assurance (iRA)**. To assess a studentâ€™s knowledge of the assigned reading material for a topic, students will be take an iRA. The iRA is made up of multiple-choice questions. How well a student does is an indicator of how ready they are to proceed with deepening and building their knowledge, and what areas to review.

* **Team Readiness Assurance (tRA)**. After the iRA, the same multiple-choice questions are answered
as a team. Teams select answers after discussion of the questions.

* **In-class activites** involve problem solving and data investigations in teams

* **Peer Evaluations**: You will evaluate your teammates on collaborative
skills and preparedness. Evaluations are confidential, and are factored into
course grades.

### Homeworks and Projects

You will complete homeworks weekly online. There will be three projects over the course of the semester where you will analyze real-world data sets.

#### Final Project

You will also complete a final project in teams. You will present your final project during the course's assigned exam period.

### Exams

There are 2 midterms exams on dates listed in the calendar above. 


### Grading

Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:

| Activity | Grade|
|----------|------|
| Team-Based Labs | 35% |
| Homework and Individual Readiness | 15% |
| 3 Projects | 15% |
| Final Project | 10% |
| 2 Midterm Exams | 25% |


## Frequently Asked Questions

### What background knowledge or skills do I need before taking this course?

The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students who
have not previously taken any statistics or computer science
courses. If you have some background in computer science and
statistics, consider taking CompSci 216, Everything Data or some other
more advanced course.

### Does this count count for the Computer Science major?

This course can substitute for CompSci 101 as a *prerequisite* for the major or minor. The course does not count as an elective for either the BA or BS.

### Will this course prepare me for other Computer Science courses?

After taking this course, students should have the necessary
background to take CompSci 201, Data Structures & Algorithms or
CompSci 216, Everthing Data.



## Policies

### Classroom etiquette

Every member of the class is expected to contribute to a positive learning
environment. Mobile devices and laptops should be put away when they are not part of an activity or
assessment. Arriving on time and staying for an entire class period is expected.  Here is a poignant quotation from the Duke
Community Standard that applies to our class and as a member of the broader Duke community:
[https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard]

> Citizens of the Duke community commit to acting with purpose, civility, and intention, both with
> personal decision-making and with interactions with each member of this community. Choosing
> to be a citizen of the Duke community means acknowledging the value of each member,
> participating in active reflection and asking the question, "How do my actions impact others?"

### Diversity and Inclusion

I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. 
All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive
environment for every other member of the class.

### Disability Accommodations

The staff of the [Student Disability Access Office](http://access.duke.edu/students) encourages and assists students in
understanding the nature of their disability and its impact on their living and learning at Duke
University. Their goal is to provide and coordinate accommodations, support services and programs
that enable students with disabilities to have equal access to all Duke University programs and
activities. Students are responsible for contacting SDAO and for looking up deadlines for
accommodation requests.

### Collaboration Policy

We encourage collaboration on much of the work you'll do in this course. However, in some situations, e.g., exams, your work must be done by yourself, consulting only those resources explicitly permitted by your instructor.

Studying together is always encouraged, especially when preparing for midterm exams. At other times you may be assigned to a group, e.g., for labs, homeworks, and projects.

If you aren't sure what the collaboration policy is on a lab, classwork, homework, or other project, please ask!


Most work in this course will be done in pairs or teams. With the exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.

When you collaborate, you should follow the following rules in intereacting with students outside your group"

- You must not share your code or answers directly with other students not in your assigned group.
- You must not look at solution sets or program code from other semesters.
- Cite any code or ideas you use.
