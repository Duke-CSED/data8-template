Given data arising from some real-world phenomenon, how does one turn
that data into knowledge and that knowledge into action? Students will
learn critical concepts and skills in computer programming and
statistical inference in the process of conducting analysis of
real-world datasets. Students will write computer programs for
projects using the Python programming language. In considering applications, we will discuss how data can be used responsibly to benefit society.
