## Project Overview

In your final project, you will do some analysis on a dataset of your choosing to answer questions that you pose.  You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

You can work on your project in *teams* of size 2-3. Larger teams will be expected to do proportionally more in-depth projects.

### Project Timeline

* **March 29**: Meet with Prof. Forbes to discuss your project topic and team. Schedule via [https://calendly.com/jrnf/project-discussion](https://calendly.com/jrnf/project-discussion) 
* **April 4**: Submit a project proposal (**via [Sakai](https://sakai.duke.edu/portal/directtool/51fa0753-829f-4558-af51-49bae17f07a1/)**) that describes your the dataset, questions you plan to address, and ideas about the statistical methods that may be useful in answering your questions.
* **May 3**: Submit final project document. Presentations are during the [final exam period](https://registrar.duke.edu/calendars-key-dates/exam-schedules) of 2:00-5:00. Your presentation should be 8 minutes long and all team members should speak. 

### Data Sources

The following sites should be helpful as you consider possible datasets to analyze in your project.

* [Google Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
* [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/): US Government data sources on a variety of topics
* [Blog on 100+ Interesting Datasets](http://rs.io/100-interesting-data-sets-for-statistics/)

### Project Proposal

Your project proposal should be about one page long document that describes:

* the question(s) you plan to address
* how you will split up the work among the team members
* the dataset(s) you will use and what work will be required to acquire the data and wrangle it into a useful form
* any ideas about the statistical methods that may be useful in answering your questions

### Final Project Report

The final report should be a self-contained document, clearly
motivating and defining the problem, describing your approaches as
well as alternatives and related work (if applicable), presenting
results and evaluation, and drawing your conclusions. Your final
report will should be a Jupyter notebook, but you may want to add some
further documentation as a PDF file.  If there are unresolved
problems/issues with your code or results, be sure to explain them in
a section of the report.

### Final Project Presentations

We will provide more details later. You will submit your presentations
by noon on May 3 as a PowerPoint or PDF file.
