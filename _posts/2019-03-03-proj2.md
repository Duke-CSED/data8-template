[Project 2](http://jupyterhub.cs.duke.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/DukeCS/FoDS-s19&subPath=proj/proj2/project2.ipynb&branch=master&app=notebook) is now available. This project investigates the relationship between murder and capital punishment in the United States. In this project, you will test hypotheses that arise from a natural experiment.

You should complete the assignment *in groups of up to three* by the end of the day on Tuesday, March 19. You should also **complete Parts 1 and 2 of the project (out of 5) and submit them before 11:59pm on 3/7**. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab.
